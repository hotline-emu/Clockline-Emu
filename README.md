# Clockline Emu  
##### A really niche clock application to put on my second desktop for personal asthetics.  

The first two lines really sum up exactly what this is. It is just a clock application that I created to play around and tinker with in my free time. I personally use it on my second monitor, which functions as my dashboard.  Feel free to use this if you stumble upon it.  

##### Installation instructions.  
1. Clone the git repository locally.  
2. Open the solution.  
3. Build the solution.  
4.  Grab the executable from the bin directory.  
5. ...  
6. Profit.  

###### Notes:  
* Currently, the location is using a free API that is keyless. It is not the best, but it was free, keyless, and working.  
* There are plans to add more stuff in the future, but the design is not going in any particular direction. This is just a toy sandbox to tinker with stuff when I get bored at the moment.
